## ðŸš€ Next Priority Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Game API Structure (Next Session)

1. **Design Game API Architecture**
   - [ ] Define core game entities (Player, Game, Session)
   - [ ] Create basic interfaces (GameEngine, GameState)
   - [ ] Implement game lifecycle management
   - [ ] Add basic REST endpoints structure

2. **Expand Core Classes**
   - [ ] Create `Player` class with basic properties
   - [ ] Create `Game` class with game state management
   - [ ] Create `GameSession` for session handling
   - [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for each class

3. **Add Configuration Management**
   - [ ] Add `application.properties` for configuration
   - [ ] Implement environment-specific settings
   - [ ] Add logging configuration (Logback/SLF4J)

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (Following Sessions)

4. **React Frontend Setup**
   - [ ] Create React TypeScript project in `src/main/webapp/`
   - [ ] Add Maven frontend plugin for build integration
   - [ ] Configure Quarkus to serve React static resources
   - [ ] Setup development workflow (hot reload for both frontend/backend)

5. **Frontend-Backend API Integration**
   - [ ] Create API client for React frontend
   - [ ] Implement game UI components (lobby, game board, player info)
   - [ ] Add error handling and loading states
   - [ ] Setup WebSocket connection for real-time features

### Phase 3: Technology Integration (Later Sessions)

6. **Database Integration**
   - [ ] Add H2 database for development
   - [ ] Implement JPA entities
   - [ ] Create repository layer
   - [ ] Add database migration scripts

7. **REST API Development**
   - [ ] Migrate to Quarkus framework
   - [ ] Create JAX-RS REST controllers
   - [ ] Implement API endpoints for game operations
   - [ ] Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

8. **Authentication & Security**
   - [ ] Implement Keycloak integration (backend)
   - [ ] Add Keycloak JS adapter (frontend)
   - [ ] Create secured game routes and API endpoints
   - [ ] Implement role-based access control

## ðŸ“š Learning Path (Based on Keycloak Stack)

### Current Focus: Foundation Technologies
- **Status**: âœ… Java 17 setup complete
- **Next**: Jakarta EE basics and REST service development

### Upcoming Technologies to Integrate
1. **RESTEasy (JAX-RS)** - REST service endpoints
2. **Hibernate/JPA** - Database persistence
3. **Quarkus Framework** - Cloud-native development
4. **Undertow Web Server** - Embedded web server

## ðŸ”§ Development Workflow

### When Resuming Development
1. Run `jenv-info` to verify Java 17 environment
2. Run `mvn clean test` to ensure current state is working
3. Check this file for next priority tasks
4. Use `cnp` for conventional commits

### Current Commands Available
- `run` - Execute main GameAPI class
- `test` - Run JUnit tests  
- `build` - Compile project
- `tree` - View project structure

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas & Notes

### Full-Stack Game API Concepts to Implement
- **React game UI with real-time updates**
- **Multi-player game support with WebSocket**
- **Game lobby and matchmaking interface**
- **Leaderboards and statistics dashboard**
- **Game replay system with UI playback**
- **Single JAR deployment (Java API + React frontend)**

### Technical Decisions Made
- Package structure: `uk.thirteen11.game` (clean, professional)
- Domain integration: All classes reference 1311.uk domain
- Testing: JUnit 5 with comprehensive test coverage
- Commit style: Conventional commits via `cnp` shortcut

### Questions for Next Session
- Which type of games should the API support first?
- Should we start with React setup or complete the backend API first?
- What build tool should we use for React (Vite vs Create React App)?
- How should we structure the Maven build to include React compilation?
- Should we implement WebSocket for real-time features from the start?
